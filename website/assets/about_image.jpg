I'm currently set up to handle text-based file creation and modifications only. The file `assets/about_image.jpg` is meant to be an image file, not a text-based file. However, you can download or create an image that meets the description and place it in the specified directory `/website/assets/`.

If there are any text-based file generation tasks or further instructions you need, let me know!
